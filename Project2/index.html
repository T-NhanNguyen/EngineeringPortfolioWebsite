                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <p>This was a collaborative project made by me and my brother Tam Nguyen, with special thanks to Ryan Bates for the cad model of the Joystick. Many problems occurred within this project due to the restriction of the microcontroller we
                        used. As a result, we have to improvise solutions to meet our project's objective<br></p>

                        <p>The objective of this project was to learn more about the field of firmware engineering while understanding more about the potential of Arduino. This prototype is a budgeted portable human interface device with a familiar appearance
                            to an arcade-style gamepad. The focus was to have it capable of being used as a serial bus device among various operating systems and applications such as a gaming controller and automated machinery.<br></p>
                        <p>This project was made for our capstone project at Clark college. While this capstone was not needed as I've already done it in the previous year due to my complicated schedule, I've taken it upon myself to pick up a new project
                            as an interest and hobby. This project was done with my brother Tam Nguyen, who is a computer science major, as he was responsible for the development of the java program that helped this restricted microcontroller work with
                            a window's operating system.</p>
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>Using an Arduino as the microprocessor for the project, I developed the system that processes the user’s input from the interactive 3d printed joysticks and buttons as a digital signal for feedback to the computer. An application
                            developed by my team uses the serial port that the gamepad is connected to and converts the feedback into emulated keystroke for Windows or Linux operating systems.<br></p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>As a challenge to ourselves, my team and I set a small budget for ourselves in creating this project. In doing so, we had significant limitations on the components used. However, this allowed us to develop hands-on prototyping
                            skills by solving problems through analysis and developing work arounds to our resource limitation. Specifically, we programmed an application that could emulate the functions that the microcontroller controller wasn’t capable
                            of handling.<br></p>
